# Voice Assistant

This is a simple yet powerful voice assistant application built using Python, Kivy, pyttsx3 for speech synthesis, and Qroq AI API for advanced processing. The app listens to user input via the microphone, processes it, and responds using speech synthesis. It can also perform various actions like opening and closing applications on Windows and navigating to websites.

## Features
* **Responds to User Input:** The voice assistant listens to the user's voice commands and provides appropriate responses.
* **Advanced Processing with Qroq AI API:** Leverages the power of Qroq AI API for enhanced command processing and response generation.
* **Open and Close Applications on Windows:** The assistant can open and close various applications on a Windows system.
* **Opens Websites:** Users can command the assistant to open specified websites
* **Voice Recognition:** Utilizes the 'speech_recognition' library to convert spoken words into text.
* **Speech Synthesis:** Uses pyttsx3 to convert text responses into spoken words.
* **Dynamic UI Updates:** The user interface, built with Kivy and KivyMD, updates dynamically based on interactions.
* **Interactive Chatbot Interface:** Provides a visually appealing and interactive interface for user interaction.
